      <p>The rise of AI necessitates a greater emphasis on quality engineering over coding efforts.</p>
  
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Coding VS Testing</h3>
      <p>AI simplifies coding but amplifies testing demands. While AI automates development, testing must expand to validate both functional and non-functional requirements — like performance, usability, and security.</p>
      <p>Traditionally, testing accounts for about 50% of efforts, but in AI-powered development, it must double to ensure reliability.</p>
